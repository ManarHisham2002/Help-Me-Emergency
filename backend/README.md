this is a  simple Sticky notes app
you can :
    add Note 
    delete Note 
    get Note by their _id  
    get all Notes 
    update Note 

    and to test populate() , you should use

    //signIn


I used new functions to build its CRUD opertations and these are have a diffrenent logic from my last projects  : 
  noteModel (schema for Note and User) 
  .populate()  (simple to get the info of a user for each note)
  .insertMany()
  .findOne()
  .findByIdAndUpdate()
  .findByIdAndDelete()
